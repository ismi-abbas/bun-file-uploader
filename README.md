# bun-s3-uploader

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.6.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

### Notes
Because of aws-sdk is not supported yet by Bun(need http2), so this repo is just a playaround with bun filesystem
